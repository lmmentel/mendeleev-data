All molybdenum compounds should be considered highly toxic, and will also cause severe birth defects.","dipole_polarizability":86.999999999999999998,"electron_affinity":0.74799999999999999822,"electronic_configuration":"[Kr] 4d5 5s","evaporation_heat":590.0,"fusion_heat":27.999999999999999999,"group_id":6,"lattice_constant":3.1499999999999999111,"lattice_structure":"BCC","name":"Molybdenum","period":5,"series_id":8,"specific_heat_capacity":0.25100000000000000088,"symbol":"Mo","thermal_conductivity":null,"vdw_radius":217.0,"covalent_radius_cordero":153.99999999999999999,"covalent_radius_pyykko":137.99999999999999999,"en_pauling":2.1600000000000001421,"en_allen":8.7100000000000008526,"jmol_color":"#54b5b5","cpk_color":"#ff1493","proton_affinity":null,"gas_basicity":null,"heat_of_formation":658.98000000000001817,"c6":null,"covalent_radius_bragg":null,"vdw_radius_bondi":null,"vdw_radius_truhlar":null,"vdw_radius_rt":null,"vdw_radius_batsanov":209.99999999999999999,"vdw_radius_dreiding":null,"vdw_radius_uff":305.19999999999998863,"vdw_radius_mm3":239.0,"abundance_crust":1.1999999999999999555,"abundance_sea":0.010000000000000000208,"molcas_gv_color":"#54b5b5","en_ghosh":0.13126720000000000054,"vdw_radius_alvarez":245.0,"c6_gb":1029.9999999999999999,"atomic_weight":95.950000000000002838,"atomic_weight_uncertainty":0.010000000000000000208,"is_monoisotopic":null,"is_radioactive":0,"cas":"7439-98-7","atomic_radius_rahm":244.0,"geochemical_class":null,"goldschmidt_class":"siderophile","metallic_radius":129.99999999999999999,"metallic_radius_c12":138.99999999999999999,"covalent_radius_pyykko_double":121.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko_triple":112.99999999999999999,"discoverers":"Carl Wilhelm Scheele","discovery_year":1778,"discovery_location":"Sweden","name_origin":"Greek: molybdos (lead).","sources":"Found in the minerals molybdenite (MoS2) and wulfenite (MoO4Pb).","uses":"Its alloys are used in aircraft, missiles, and protective coatings in boiler plate.","mendeleev_number":52,"dipole_polarizability_unc":6.0,"pettifor_number":55,"glawe_number":56,"molar_heat_capacity":24.05999999999999872,"en_miedema":4.6500000000000003552,"miedema_molar_volume":9.4000000000000003552,"miedema_electron_density":5.5499999999999998223},

The dust however, presents a fire and explosion hazard.","dipole_polarizability":207.99999999999999999,"electron_affinity":1.9159999999999999253,"electronic_configuration":"[Xe] 4f4 6s2","evaporation_heat":289.00000000000000001,"fusion_heat":7.0999999999999996447,"group_id":null,"lattice_constant":3.6600000000000001421,"lattice_structure":"HEX","name":"Neodymium","period":6,"series_id":9,"specific_heat_capacity":0.19000000000000000222,"symbol":"Nd","thermal_conductivity":null,"vdw_radius":239.0,"covalent_radius_cordero":200.99999999999997157,"covalent_radius_pyykko":174.0,"en_pauling":1.1399999999999999023,"en_allen":null,"jmol_color":"#c7ffc7","cpk_color":"#ff1493","proton_affinity":null,"gas_basicity":null,"heat_of_formation":326.89999999999997727,"c6":null,"covalent_radius_bragg":null,"vdw_radius_bondi":null,"vdw_radius_truhlar":null,"vdw_radius_rt":null,"vdw_radius_batsanov":null,"vdw_radius_dreiding":null,"vdw_radius_uff":357.5,"vdw_radius_mm3":273.0,"abundance_crust":41.5,"abundance_sea":2.7999999999999998735e-06,"molcas_gv_color":"#c7ffc7","en_ghosh":0.17653900000000000147,"vdw_radius_alvarez":295.0,"c6_gb":3559.9999999999999999,"atomic_weight":144.24199999999999022,"atomic_weight_uncertainty":0.0030000000000000000624,"is_monoisotopic":null,"is_radioactive":0,"cas":"7440-00-8","atomic_radius_rahm":283.99999999999999999,"geochemical_class":"rare earth & related","goldschmidt_class":"litophile","metallic_radius":null,"metallic_radius_c12":null,"covalent_radius_pyykko_double":137.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko_triple":null,"discoverers":"C.F.

One natural isotope, Ho-165 exists, six radioisotopes exist, the most stable being Ho-163 with a half-life of 4570 years. Holmium is used in some metal alloys, it is also said to stimulate the metabolism. Discovered by Per Theodor Cleve and J.L. Soret in Switzerland in 1879. The name homium comes from the Greek word Holmia which means Sweden. While all holmium compounds should be considered highly toxic, initial evidence seems to indicate that they do not pose much danger. The metal's dust however, is a fire hazard.","dipole_polarizability":155.99999999999999999,"electron_affinity":null,"electronic_configuration":"[Xe] 4f11 6s2","evaporation_heat":300.99999999999999999,"fusion_heat":null,"group_id":null,"lattice_constant":3.580000000000000071,"lattice_structure":"HEX","name":"Holmium","period":6,"series_id":9,"specific_heat_capacity":0.16500000000000000777,"symbol":"Ho","thermal_conductivity":null,"vdw_radius":229.99999999999997156,"covalent_radius_cordero":191.99999999999999999,"covalent_radius_pyykko":165.99999999999999999,"en_pauling":1.2299999999999999822,"en_allen":null,"jmol_color":"#00ff9c","cpk_color":"#ff1493","proton_affinity":null,"gas_basicity":null,"heat_of_formation":300.60000000000002273,"c6":null,"covalent_radius_bragg":null,"vdw_radius_bondi":null,"vdw_radius_truhlar":null,"vdw_radius_rt":null,"vdw_radius_batsanov":null,"vdw_radius_dreiding":null,"vdw_radius_uff":340.89999999999997725,"vdw_radius_mm3":267.0,"abundance_crust":1.3000000000000000444,"abundance_sea":2.2000000000000001121e-07,"molcas_gv_color":"#00ff9c","en_ghosh":0.20779499999999997972,"vdw_radius_alvarez":280.99999999999999999,"c6_gb":2279.9999999999999999,"atomic_weight":164.93032999999999787,"atomic_weight_uncertainty":2.0000000000000001634e-05,"is_monoisotopic":1,"is_radioactive":0,"cas":"7440-60-0","atomic_radius_rahm":273.0,"geochemical_class":"rare earth & related","goldschmidt_class":"litophile","metallic_radius":null,"metallic_radius_c12":null,"covalent_radius_pyykko_double":133.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko_triple":null,"discoverers":"J.L.
