Originally discovered by Andres Manuel del Rio of Mexico City in 1801. His discovery went unheeded, however, and in 1820, Nils Gabriel Sefstron of Sweden rediscovered it. Metallic vanadium was isolated by Henry Enfield Roscoe in 1867. The name vanadium comes from Vanadis, a goddess of Scandinavian mythology. Silvery-white metallic transition element.

Molybdenum is used in almost all high-strength steels, it has nuclear applications, and is a catalyst in petroleum refining. Discovered in 1778 by Carl Welhelm Scheele of Sweden. Impure metal was prepared in 1782 by Peter Jacob Hjelm. The name comes from the Greek word molybdos which means lead. Trace amounts of molybdenum are required for all known forms of life. All molybdenum compounds should be considered highly toxic, and will also cause severe birth defects.","dipole_polarizability":86.999999999999999998,"electron_affinity":0.74799999999999999822,"electronic_configuration":"[Kr] 4d5 5s","evaporation_heat":590.0,"fusion_heat":27.999999999999999999,"group_id":6,"lattice_constant":3.1499999999999999111,"lattice_structure":"BCC","name":"Molybdenum","period":5,"series_id":8,"specific_heat_capacity":0.25100000000000000088,"symbol":"Mo","thermal_conductivity":null,"vdw_radius":217.0,"covalent_radius_cordero":153.99999999999999999,"covalent_radius_pyykko":137.99999999999999999,"en_pauling":2.1600000000000001421,"en_allen":8.7100000000000008526,"jmol_color":"#54b5b5","cpk_color":"#ff1493","proton_affinity":null,"gas_basicity":null,"heat_of_formation":658.98000000000001817,"c6":null,"covalent_radius_bragg":null,"vdw_radius_bondi":null,"vdw_radius_truhlar":null,"vdw_radius_rt":null,"vdw_radius_batsanov":209.99999999999999999,"vdw_radius_dreiding":null,"vdw_radius_uff":305.19999999999998863,"vdw_radius_mm3":239.0,"abundance_crust":1.1999999999999999555,"abundance_sea":0.010000000000000000208,"molcas_gv_color":"#54b5b5","en_ghosh":0.13126720000000000054,"vdw_radius_alvarez":245.0,"c6_gb":1029.9999999999999999,"atomic_weight":95.950000000000002838,"atomic_weight_uncertainty":0.010000000000000000208,"is_monoisotopic":null,"is_radioactive":0,"cas":"7439-98-7","atomic_radius_rahm":244.0,"geochemical_class":null,"goldschmidt_class":"siderophile","metallic_radius":129.99999999999999999,"metallic_radius_c12":138.99999999999999999,"covalent_radius_pyykko_double":121.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko_triple":112.99999999999999999,"discoverers":"Carl Wilhelm Scheele","discovery_year":1778,"discovery_location":"Sweden","name_origin":"Greek: molybdos (lead).","sources":"Found in the minerals molybdenite (MoS2) and wulfenite (MoO4Pb).","uses":"Its alloys are used in aircraft, missiles, and protective coatings in boiler plate.","mendeleev_number":52,"dipole_polarizability_unc":6.0,"pettifor_number":55,"glawe_number":56,"molar_heat_capacity":24.05999999999999872,"en_miedema":4.6500000000000003552,"miedema_molar_volume":9.4000000000000003552,"miedema_electron_density":5.5499999999999998223},

The dust however, presents a fire and explosion hazard.","dipole_polarizability":207.99999999999999999,"electron_affinity":1.9159999999999999253,"electronic_configuration":"[Xe] 4f4 6s2","evaporation_heat":289.00000000000000001,"fusion_heat":7.0999999999999996447,"group_id":null,"lattice_constant":3.6600000000000001421,"lattice_structure":"HEX","name":"Neodymium","period":6,"series_id":9,"specific_heat_capacity":0.19000000000000000222,"symbol":"Nd","thermal_conductivity":null,"vdw_radius":239.0,"covalent_radius_cordero":200.99999999999997157,"covalent_radius_pyykko":174.0,"en_pauling":1.1399999999999999023,"en_allen":null,"jmol_color":"#c7ffc7","cpk_color":"#ff1493","proton_affinity":null,"gas_basicity":null,"heat_of_formation":326.89999999999997727,"c6":null,"covalent_radius_bragg":null,"vdw_radius_bondi":null,"vdw_radius_truhlar":null,"vdw_radius_rt":null,"vdw_radius_batsanov":null,"vdw_radius_dreiding":null,"vdw_radius_uff":357.5,"vdw_radius_mm3":273.0,"abundance_crust":41.5,"abundance_sea":2.7999999999999998735e-06,"molcas_gv_color":"#c7ffc7","en_ghosh":0.17653900000000000147,"vdw_radius_alvarez":295.0,"c6_gb":3559.9999999999999999,"atomic_weight":144.24199999999999022,"atomic_weight_uncertainty":0.0030000000000000000624,"is_monoisotopic":null,"is_radioactive":0,"cas":"7440-00-8","atomic_radius_rahm":283.99999999999999999,"geochemical_class":"rare earth & related","goldschmidt_class":"litophile","metallic_radius":null,"metallic_radius_c12":null,"covalent_radius_pyykko_double":137.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko_triple":null,"discoverers":"C.F.

Platinum metal is generally not a health concern due to its unreactivity, however platinum compounds should be considered highly toxic.","dipole_polarizability":48.000000000000000001,"electron_affinity":2.1280000000000001136,"electronic_configuration":"[Xe] 4f14 5d9 6s","evaporation_heat":469.99999999999999998,"fusion_heat":21.760000000000001563,"group_id":10,"lattice_constant":3.9199999999999999289,"lattice_structure":"FCC","name":"Platinum","period":6,"series_id":8,"specific_heat_capacity":0.1330000000000000071,"symbol":"Pt","thermal_conductivity":71.599999999999994317,"vdw_radius":213.00000000000000001,"covalent_radius_cordero":136.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko":123.0,"en_pauling":2.2000000000000001776,"en_allen":10.160000000000000142,"jmol_color":"#d0d0e0","cpk_color":"#ff1493","proton_affinity":null,"gas_basicity":null,"heat_of_formation":565.70000000000004547,"c6":null,"covalent_radius_bragg":null,"vdw_radius_bondi":null,"vdw_radius_truhlar":null,"vdw_radius_rt":null,"vdw_radius_batsanov":204.99999999999997156,"vdw_radius_dreiding":null,"vdw_radius_uff":275.39999999999997726,"vdw_radius_mm3":239.0,"abundance_crust":0.005000000000000000104,"abundance_sea":null,"molcas_gv_color":"#d0d0e0","en_ghosh":0.25690999999999997172,"vdw_radius_alvarez":228.99999999999999999,"c6_gb":469.99999999999999998,"atomic_weight":195.08400000000000318,"atomic_weight_uncertainty":0.0090000000000000010547,"is_monoisotopic":null,"is_radioactive":0,"cas":"7440-06-4","atomic_radius_rahm":229.99999999999997156,"geochemical_class":"noble metal","goldschmidt_class":"siderophile","metallic_radius":129.99999999999999999,"metallic_radius_c12":138.99999999999999999,"covalent_radius_pyykko_double":112.0,"covalent_radius_pyykko_triple":110.0,"discoverers":"Julius Scaliger","discovery_year":1735,"discovery_location":"Italy","name_origin":"Spanish: platina (little silver).","sources":"Produced from deposits of native, or elemental, platinum.","uses":"Used in jewelry, to make crucible and special containers and as a catalyst.
